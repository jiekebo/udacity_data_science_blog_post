# Investigation into the Airbnb dataset
This project focuses on the analysis on the Airbnb dataset provided freely available by Kaggle. This was done in connection the the awesome Data Science Nanodegree program on Udacity.

The main notebook where the work was done is present in this Github repository and is named `Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb`. In order to run this notebook you will have to create a directory named `data` containing `calendar.csv`, `listings.csv` and `reviews.csv` which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). The `images` directory contains pictures used for the Medium article.
